Lantz is an automation and instrumentation toolkit with a clean, well-designed
and consistent interface. It provides a core of commonly used functionalities
for building applications that communicate with scientific instruments
allowing rapid application prototyping, development and testing. Lantz
benefits from Python's extensive library flexibility as a glue language to
wrap existing drivers and DLLs.
